# 2026-02-06 Daily Notes

## Skills Installed

### ClawdHub Skills (2026-02-06)
- `tavily-search` - AI-optimized web search (needs API key from tavily.com)
- `find-skills` - Skill discovery and installation
- `proactive-agent-1-2-4` - Proactive self-improving agent architecture

**Location:** ~/.claudeai/skills/

## Technical Issues Fixed

### NPM/Node Environment (2026-02-06)
- System npm was broken after OpenClaw installation
- Solution: `nvm install --latest-npm` to reinstall npm
- Use `nvm use 25` or set PATH to v25 for working npm
- clawdhub needs `undici` package: `npm install -g undici`

### Cron Task Issue (Morning)
- System cron failed to send Telegram messages
- **Root cause:** Cron environment is isolated, cannot access OpenClaw tools
- **Solution:** Use OpenClaw's built-in cron (`openclaw cron add`)
- Created job: `ai-daily-digest` - runs daily at 7:35 AM, delivers to Telegram

## Important Learnings

1. **For cron tasks:** Always use OpenClaw built-in cron, not system cron
2. **Verify before assuming:** Check if messages actually sent, not just if script ran
3. **Test in production environment:** What works locally may fail in cron/scheduled context

## API Keys Needed

- **Tavily API:** https://tavily.com (for tavily-search skill)
- **Brave API:** BSAFqErkJarOZiOdBO-Cs_TctVwkEN1 (still 403, needs verification)
